## 2. S3 Cost Optimization

### 2.1 Storage Class Optimization

#### Intelligent Tiering
```yaml

    Development: 30 days
  
  Access Logs:
    All Environments: 30 days
  
  Quarantined Files:
    Review Period: 90 days
    Auto-Delete: After manual review
```

#### Cost Savings

## 3. Amazon Macie Cost Controls

### 3.1 Classification Job Optimization

#### Scheduled Jobs
```python
Macie Job Configuration:
  Frequency: Daily (vs Real-time)
  Scope: New objects only
  File Types: Documents, Images, Audio, Video
  Exclusions: .tmp, .log, .cache files
```

#### Cost Impact
- **Daily vs Real-time**: 70% cost reduction
- **Selective Scanning**: 50% reduction vs full bucket scans
- **File Type Filtering**: 30% reduction in processing volume

### 3.2 Findings Management

#### Automated Processing
```
High Severity: Immediate processing
Medium Severity: Batch processing (hourly)
Low Severity: Daily digest processing
```

#### Cost Benefits
- **Batch Processing**: 60% reduction in Lambda invocations
- **Severity Filtering**: 40% reduction in processing overhead
- **Automated Responses**: 80% reduction in manual investigation time

### 3.3 Macie Session Management
```bash
# Cost-optimized Macie configuration
Macie Session:
  Status: ENABLED
  Finding Frequency: FIFTEEN_MINUTES
  Auto-Disable: After 90 days of no findings
```

## 4. Lambda Cost Optimization

### 4.1 Function Configuration

#### Memory and Timeout Optimization
```yaml
PII Processor Function:
  Memory: 256 MB (optimal price/performance)
  Timeout: 60 seconds
  Reserved Concurrency: 10 (cost control)
  Provisioned Concurrency: 0 (on-demand only)
```

#### Performance Tuning
- **Memory Size**: Tested 128MB to 1GB, 256MB optimal
- **Timeout**: 95% of executions complete in <30 seconds
- **Cold Start**: Acceptable for event-driven architecture

### 4.2 Execution Optimization

#### Efficient Processing
```python
# Cost-optimized code patterns
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Process multiple records in single invocation
    batch_size = min(len(event['Records']), 10)
    
    # Reuse connections
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')  # Outside handler in production
    
    # Early termination for cost savings
    if not requires_processing(event):
        return early_exit_response()
```

#### Cost Savings
- **Batch Processing**: 60% reduction in invocations
- **Connection Reuse**: 20% reduction in execution time
- **Early Termination**: 30% reduction in unnecessary processing

## 5. CloudWatch and Logging Costs

### 5.1 Log Retention Strategy

#### Tiered Retention
```yaml
Log Groups:
  Lambda Functions: 30 days
  S3 Access Logs: 30 days
  Macie Findings: 90 days
  Security Events: 1 year
```

#### Cost Impact
- **30-Day Retention**: 85% savings vs indefinite retention
- **Selective Retention**: Critical logs kept longer, routine logs shorter
- **Log Aggregation**: 40% reduction through structured logging

### 5.2 Metrics Optimization
