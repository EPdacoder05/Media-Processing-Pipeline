# üìΩÔ∏è Intelligent Media Processing Pipeline (IMPP) - DevOps/AI/FinOps

A fully automated, event-driven AWS pipeline for ingesting, analyzing, transforming, and archiving dash cam and creative media, with built-in cost control and security.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

- **Ingest media from home lab/edge (dash cam, content creation) to AWS S3.**
- **AI Analysis:** Automatic object, scene, and content detection (Rekognition, Transcribe).
- **Transformation:** Multi-format transcoding (MediaConvert) for web/mobile/YouTube.
- **Smart Archiving:** S3 Intelligent Tiering, Glacier for cost savings.
- **Observability:** Real-time monitoring, alerting, and FinOps reporting.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS account (MFA, IAM best practices)
- Pulumi/Terraform CLI
- Python 3.11+ or Node.js (Lambda)
- Local server for dash cam uploads

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/media-processing-pipeline.git
cd media-processing-pipeline/infra
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure

- Use Pulumi/Terraform to provision all AWS resources.
- Place all sensitive config (bucket names, webhook URLs) in Secrets Manager.

### 3. Configure Edge Upload Script

- Script watches dash cam directory, syncs new files to S3 with metadata.
- Includes checksum, source, and timestamp tags.

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Secrets:** All secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.
- **S3:** All buckets private, server-side encryption enabled, Macie scans for PII.
- **IAM:** Least-privilege roles for all functions/services.
- **Alerting:** SNS/Slack/Discord for all critical pipeline events.
- **Audit:** CloudWatch logs for all pipeline steps.

## üìä Observability & Cost Control

- CloudWatch Dashboards for processing stats and cost metrics.
- Automated alerts for failures or unexpected cost increases.
- S3 lifecycle policies for cost-effective storage.
